* There's 36 columns of 5,121 shots taken

* Each row and observation is a singular shot taken during the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs

* Categorical variables: shooterName, event, shotGeneratedRebound

* Continuous variables: shooterTimeOnIce, shotAngle, shotDistance, tim

### Player's Shoot Mostly Between 16 and 42 Seconds On Ice

```{r graph-1, fig.height=6.5, fig.width = 14, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
playoff_shot_data %>%
  filter(shooterTimeOnIce <= 150) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = shooterTimeOnIce)) +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +
  labs(x = "Player's Time on Ice",

### Shots Closer to the Goal Generate More Rebounds

```{r graph-2, fig.height=6.5, fig.width = 14, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
playoff_shot_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = arenaAdjustedShotDistance, color = as.factor(shotGeneratedRebound))) +

  labs(x = "Arena Adjusted Shot Distance",
       y = "Percent of Rebounds",
       fill = "Shot Generated Rebound") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### How Time and Periods Affect Event Outcomes

```{r graph-3, fig.height=6.5, fig.width = 14, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
playoff_shot_data %>%
  filter(time<=3600) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +

  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1200) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2400) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 20)) +
  facet_grid(event ~., margins = TRUE, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(x = "Time (seconds)",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Different Event Frequencies",
       subtitle = "GOAL = goal, MISS = missed net, SHOT = shot on target")

### Clustering Hockey Players Based on Shot Distance and Shot Angle

```{r graph-4, fig.height=6.5, fig.width = 14, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
player_shot_stats <- playoff_shot_data %>%
  group_by(shooterName) %>%
  summarize(shots = n(),
            avg_shot_distance = mean(shotDistance, na.rm = T),
            avg_shot_angle = mean(shotAngle, na.rm = T)) %>%
  filter(shots >= 10)

hockey_player_dist <- dist(dplyr::select(player_shot_stats,
                                  avg_shot_distance, avg_shot_angle))

hockey_complete_hclust <- hclust(hockey_player_dist, method = "complete")

player_shot_stats %>%
  mutate(Cluster = as.factor(cutree(hockey_complete_hclust, k = 5))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_shot_distance, y = avg_shot_angle,
             color = Cluster)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7, size = 4) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme_reach() +
  labs(x = "Average Shot Distance",
       y = "Average Shot Angle",
       fill = "Cluster") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Hockey Position Groups

```{r out.width='90%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.hockeymonkey.com/media/wysiwyg/Hockey/guides/diagram-of-hockey-positions_2_.png")
```

## Conclusions

* The data shows the bulk of players will shoot between 16 and 42 seconds of coming on ice. 

* We found shots closer to the goal generate more rebounds: 50% of rebounds occur while the shot is taken within 25 feet of the goal while non-rebounds happen 50% of the time within 35 feet. 

* Based on period and time, there are disparities between when players shoot and where those shots end up.

### Limitations

* This should not represent the NHL as a whole as this is just a playoff hockey dataset so it's a small sample size. 

* Additionally, players might play differently in the playoffs than regular season so no definitive conclusions should be made.
